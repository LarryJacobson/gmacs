## Results culminating from the mid-January 2015 crab modeling workshop

The following summarizes the outcome of some rudimentary comparisons between the
existing Bristol Bay red king crab (BBRKC) model and an emulated version using
the gmacs platform.  Since the BBRKC model from Zheng et al. (2014) treats
recruits by sex along with sex-specific natural mortality and fishing mortality,
results from the male components are compared with results from a `gmacs` model
implementation tuned to male-only data.
